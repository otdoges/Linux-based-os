## Building PrivaLinux OS

### Prerequisites

#### For Linux
- Linux system (Ubuntu/Linux Mint recommended)
- Required packages:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
      squashfs-tools \
      xorriso \
      isolinux \
      genisoimage \
      rsync \
      wget \
      zenity
  ```

#### For Windows
- Windows 10/11 with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) enabled
- Ubuntu installed in WSL
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
```

### Build Steps

#### For Linux
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/otdoges/Linux-based-os.git
   cd privalinux
   ```

2. Make the build script executable:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   chmod +x build_iso.sh
   ```

3. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   sudo ./build_iso.sh
   ```

#### For Windows
1. Clone the repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/otdoges/Linux-based-os.git
   cd privalinux
   ```

2. Run the PowerShell build script:
   ```powershell
   cd scripts
   .\build_iso.ps1
   ```
The build process will:

- Download the base Linux Mint ISO
- Extract and customize it
- Install privacy-focused packages
- Apply security configurations
- Create the final ISO in the output directory
Build time varies depending on your system and internet connection (typically 30-60 minutes).
